## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is HTML and how to create an HTML page
- What is a markup language
- What is the DOM (Document Object Model)
- What are HTML elements/tags and attributes
- What is CSS and how to add style to an element
- What is a class and selector
- How to compute CSS specificity value
- What are Box properties in CSS
- How browsers load webpages

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup language for structuring web content
- **CSS3**: Styling language for designing web pages
- **Web Fonts**: Google Fonts integration (Yeseva One, Josefin Sans)

## 📋 Files Description

### HTML Files

- **`base_index.html`**: Base template file serving as a starting point for HTML structure
- **`index.html`**: Main webpage containing:

  - Semantic HTML structure with header, main, and footer
  - Sample content with Lorem ipsum text
  - Data table with sample user information
  - ALX logo image integration
  - Proper HTML5 document structure

- **`tweets.html`**: Secondary page demonstrating:
  - HTML heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
  - Multiple paragraph elements
  - Similar header and navigation structure

### CSS Files

- **`base.css`**: Foundation stylesheet containing:

  - CSS reset rules for consistent cross-browser rendering
  - Web font imports (Yeseva One, Josefin Sans)
  - Base styling rules and layout foundations
  - Comprehensive element reset for consistent styling

- **`styles.css`**: Custom stylesheet for project-specific styles (currently empty, ready for customization)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theisraelolaleye/alx_html_css.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx_html_css/css_basic
   ```

3. Open the HTML files in your web browser:
   - Open `index.html` to view the main page
   - Open `tweets.html` to view the secondary page

## 💻 Development

To work on this project:

1. Edit the HTML files (`index.html`, `tweets.html`) to modify content and structure
2. Add custom styles to `styles.css` for visual enhancements
3. The `base.css` file provides the foundation - avoid modifying it unless necessary
4. Test your changes by opening the HTML files in different web browsers

## 🎨 Styling Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML5 elements for proper document structure
- Follow CSS best practices for maintainable code
- Utilize the provided web fonts for typography
- Build upon the base styles provided in `base.css`
- Keep custom styles organized in `styles.css`
